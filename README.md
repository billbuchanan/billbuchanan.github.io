## Bio
William (Bill) J Buchanan OBE FRSE  is a Professor of Applied Cryptography in the School of Computing, Edinburgh and the Built Environment at Edinburgh Napier University. He is a Fellow of the BCS and a Principal Fellow of the HEA. Bill was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for services to cybersecurity, and,  in 2024, he was appointed as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE). In 2023, he received the "Most Innovative Teacher of the Year" award at the Times Higher Education Awards 2023 (the "Oscars of Higher Education"), and was awarded “Cyber Evangelist of the Year” at the Scottish Cyber Awards in 2016 and 2025. Along with this, he has won the Best Lecturer/Tutor for Computing at the Student-voted Excellence Awards six times (2011, 2014, 2015, 2019, 2020 and 2023). Bill lives and works in Edinburgh and is a believer in fairness, justice, and freedom.  His social media tagline reflects his strong belief in changing the world for the better: "A Serial Innovator. An Old World Breaker. A New World”.
 
Bill has a strong belief in the power of education and in supporting innovation from every angle and currently leads the Blockpass ID Lab and the Centre for Cybersecurity, IoT and Cyberphysical, and the Director of the Scottish Centre of Excellence in Digital Trust and DLT.  Bill works in the areas of cryptography, blockchain, trust, digital identity and quantum processing. He has one of the most extensive cryptography sites in the World (asecuritysite.com), and is involved in many areas of novel research and teaching.  He has published over 30 academic books and over 450 academic research papers. Along with this, Bill’s work has led to many areas of impact, including a number of highly successful spin-out companies (including Zonefox, Symphonic Software, Cyan Forensics and MemCrypt), along with awards for excellence in knowledge transfer and for teaching. He recently received an ”Outstanding Contribution to Knowledge Exchange” award and was included in the FutureScot "50 Scottish Tech People Who Are Changing The World”, along with being a regular keynote speaker at a range of conferences.  Bill’s true academic passion is building, analysing and breaking cryptographic methods.

## Invited talks
The following are a sample of recent invited talks:

* 26 Jan 2026 (forthcoming). RSSA Lecture to Fellows and Guests of the Royal Scottish Society of Arts [here](https://rssa.org.uk/20260126.shtml).
* 21 Oct 2025. In London, the Bank of England and the BIS Innovation Hub London Centre hosted the DLT Innovation Challenge, an initiative exploring how central bank money could be securely settled on distributed ledgers not operated by the central bank. This included a partnership between the Scottish Centre of Excellence in Digital Trust and DLT and Nethermind. This collaboration marks another step in the dialogue between engineers and central bankers on how verifiable infrastructure can enhance trust and efficiency in financial markets. We look forward to continue this important conversation [here](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/fintech/dlt-innovation-challenge).
* 7 Oct 2025. Privacy-Aware Computation: FHE, ZKP and MPC at OpenSSL 2025 in Prague. OpenSSL 2025 is one of the most significant conferences in the world on cryptography, and includes many of the international leaders in cryptography. The rise of GenAI will see an ever-increasing amount of data being gathered from citizens, both for the training of machine learning models and in the processing of PII (Personally Identifiable Information). Unfortunately, the data gathering and processing infrastructures that we have often pay little attention to the privacy of the data gathered. This presentation outlines both the theoretical and practical aspects of building a privacy-aware data gathering and processing infrastructure using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and MPC (Multi-party Computation) [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZU8Kvc8YTV4).
* 11 Sept 2025. Invited talk at AI & Cloud Innovation Summit Scotland 2025. The use of GenAI and Agentic AI has completely changed the landscape of cybersecurity. This presentation will provide practical examples of how organisations can use GenAI within Cloud-based systems to parse, index and process data, and thus break down siloes of data. It will also outline the core weaknesses for GenAI and the mechanisms that organisations can put in place to identify and mitigate these issues [here](https://events.holyrood.com/event/ai-cloud-innovation-summit/#event-schedule-collapse-648887).
* 15 May 2025. Endnote talk at EIE 2025. This outlined how the Scottish ecosystem has supported a range of university spin-outs and discussed cutting-edge developments in cybersecurity, AI and cryptography and their potential impact on Scotland’s tech ecosystem [here](https://www.eie-invest.com/speakers/bill-buchanan).

## Conferences organised
The following are recently organised conferences:

* 23 Oct 2025. International Conference On Digital Identity, Digital Wallets And AI. Our groundbreaking Conference brought together leading innovators, policymakers, and visionaries who are redefining how we think about identity, trust, and finance. Digital Identity is no longer an emerging technology – it’s the backbone of tomorrow’s digital systems. From the EU’s revolutionary implementation of e-ID and e-IDAS2, to the UK’s plans for increased use of digital ID, we’re witnessing a shift in how trust, security, and commerce intersect. This is your exclusive opportunity to hear directly from the visionaries and technical pioneers who are architecting these transformative systems. Explore strategic roadmaps, breakthrough innovations, and gain insider access to the minds shaping the future of digital trust [here](https://coetrust.com/events-digital-id-23-oct/).
